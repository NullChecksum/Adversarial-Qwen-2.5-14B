# Qwen Adversarial Prompt Generator

Important: The model is private and may be used only with proper authorization.
My objective was to conduct research to understand how an LLM can be fine-tuned to extend its capabilities and become a more useful tool than other AI models, even when faced with adversarial prompts that employ sophisticated encoding techniques and emotional loading.

## Project Overview

This project represents a comprehensive system for testing AI security through adversarial prompt generation. The goal was to create a specialized model capable of **generating realistic, human-authentic prompts that test AI systems across multiple attack vectors**, helping security teams identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.

The work spans from initial system design through model fine-tuning to final deployment, creating a production-ready tool for AI security testing. Every component has been carefully engineered to produce prompts that are sophisticated enough to reveal genuine vulnerabilities while maintaining ethical boundaries for legitimate security research.
